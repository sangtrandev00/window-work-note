Understanding how SQL processes queries step by step can help you write efficient queries and optimize performance. Here's a breakdown of your query with an explanation of what happens behind the scenes:

---

### **1. FROM Clause**

The `FROM` clause is processed first. It determines the base dataset and includes any `JOIN` operations.

- The query starts with `FROM member m`. This sets the base table (`m`) for the query.
- Next, it performs a **LEFT JOIN** with `situation st`:
    - This means all rows from the `member` table will be included, even if there is no matching row in the `situation` table.
    - The condition for this join is `m.family_id = st.member_family_id`.
- Then, it performs another **LEFT JOIN** with the `group g` table:
    - The condition is `st.group_id = g.group_id AND st.client_code = g.client_code`.
    - If a match is found in the `group` table, it is included; otherwise, nulls are returned.
- Finally, it performs a **LEFT JOIN** with the `group_period gp` table:
    - The condition is `gp.group_id = g.group_id AND gp.client_code = g.client_code`.

At this point, the SQL engine builds a **temporary dataset** containing the results of all the joins. This dataset includes columns from `member`, `situation`, `group`, and `group_period`.

---

### **2. WHERE Clause**

The `WHERE` clause filters rows **after the joins** are completed but **before grouping or ordering**.

- The condition `m.family_id = '521'` is applied.
- Only rows from the temporary dataset where the `family_id` in the `member` table is `521` are kept.

---

### **3. GROUP BY Clause**

The `GROUP BY` clause groups rows into subsets based on the specified columns.

- The query specifies `GROUP BY family_id, suffix_id`.
- Rows with the same combination of `family_id` and `suffix_id` are grouped together.
- For each group, **only one row is returned**, and the selection of which row depends on the SQL implementation. Typically, this behavior is **undefined** unless aggregate functions (e.g., `SUM`, `MAX`, `MIN`) are used to specify which values to select for non-grouped columns.

---

### **4. SELECT Clause**

The `SELECT` clause determines which columns are included in the final result.

- The query uses `SELECT *`, meaning all columns from the joined tables are included in the output.
- However, because of `GROUP BY`, the values for columns not in the `GROUP BY` clause can be **ambiguous** unless they are part of an aggregate function or explicitly deterministic.

---

### **5. ORDER BY Clause**

The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the final result set.

- The query sorts rows based on `gp.effective_date DESC`.
- Since `gp.effective_date` is not in the `GROUP BY` clause, the order may depend on the SQL engine's handling of grouped rows and non-deterministic selection.

---

### **6. Final Output**

After the above steps, the SQL engine produces the result set:

- Rows grouped by `family_id` and `suffix_id`.
- Sorted by `gp.effective_date` in descending order.

---

### Key Considerations

1. **Ambiguity in `GROUP BY`:**
    
    - Without aggregate functions, columns not in `GROUP BY` may return unpredictable results.
    - Use functions like `MAX(gp.effective_date)` if specific values are needed.
2. **JOIN and Filtering:**
    
    - The joins create a large intermediate dataset before the `WHERE` clause filters it down.
3. **Performance:**
    
    - Ensure indexes exist on commonly joined and filtered columns (e.g., `m.family_id`, `st.member_family_id`, `g.group_id`).
